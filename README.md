Dr. Funky Bot

My first long-term python project!
The project primary runs on the package 'discord.py' which can be imported and used by anyone

Dr. Funky Bot was originally created to serve a simple purpose of interacting iwth members in a discord server. 
In addition to its response quips, it also has the ability to put gifs into a dabase which can be pulled by a discord member at any time.
Dr. Funky will keep growing as time goes on so make sure to keep up

(FYI this is my first time using github and creating documentation)
